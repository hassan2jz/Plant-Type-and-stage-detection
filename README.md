# Plant-Type-and-stage-detection
 In this project, we propose a deep learning-based system for automated plant type and stage detection using the Inception v3 deep neural network model. The system takes images of plants as input and can classify them into one of several predefined plant types (e.g., corn, wheat, soybean) and determine the growth stage (e.g., vegetative, flowering, fruiting). The proposed system will be trained and evaluated using our dataset which consist of 10 different plant species and 36 distinct classes for stages and achieved high accuracy for both plant type and growth stage classification. The developed system can used as potential applications in plant breeding, crop monitoring, and yield prediction.
